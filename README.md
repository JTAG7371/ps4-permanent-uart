Enables Permanent UART for PS4.

Requires a 6.72 Jailbroken PS4.

To build, you require ps4-sdk from Scene-Collective/ps4-payload-sdk

In the terminal, type make in the folder and then use bin loader from an exploit host to load the payload. 

Once done, reboot and you have permanent UART for your PS4 until you update.
